# ar-madness

Welcome! This repo contains the code for AR Madness, an ARKit game where you shoot silly things like bathubs and sharks with other silly things like bananas and axes!

We orginally built the game for the Coder Dojo Coolest Projects 2018 in Dublin, and decided to put the code online so others could learn from it.
